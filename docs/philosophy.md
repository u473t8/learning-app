- We genuinely care about the user. Others only pretend.

- The app must **always work and feel fast**:
  on slow internet, offline, on old phones, on desktops, and if needed even on a smart vape.

- In development we choose **simplicity and minimalism**:
  if a task can be solved with platform defaults, use them;
  if we can avoid a dependency, avoid it.

- **Fewer features beat a steep learning curve.**
  Usefulness matters more than feature count.

- Install, registration, and login must be **as invisible as possible**:
  open the app and use it immediately.
  Minimal forced steps and system interactions.

- We **do not aim to capture user data**.

- The app must be usable without registration.
  Registration is only for:
  - backup of progress;
  - use across multiple devices.

- We still value **visual pleasantness**:
  minimalism does not mean primitive.
