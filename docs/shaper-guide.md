# Shaper Guide (Shape Up)

This guide describes how to shape work into pitches that are ready for a bet.
Shaping is about defining the problem, a bounded solution, and the appetite so
the team can build without constant re-planning.

## Purpose

- Turn a vague idea into a concrete pitch.
- Reduce risk before a cycle starts.
- Set boundaries so executors can act independently.

## When to Shape

- The problem is real but the solution is unclear.
- The work is too big or risky to start building directly.
- We need to decide if the work is worth a cycle.

## Inputs

- **Problem**: what is broken, missing, or expensive.
- **Constraints**: product, technical, or timing limits.
- **Evidence**: user feedback, metrics, or observations.
- **Appetite**: how much time we are willing to spend (fixed).

## Shaping Steps

1. **Frame the problem**
   - Write the smallest clear statement of the user or system pain.
   - List what must be true when the problem is solved.
2. **Set appetite**
   - Pick a time box (small, medium, or large) before exploring solutions.
3. **Find a solution**
   - Explore concepts, not tasks.
   - Prefer simple models over clever architecture.
4. **Address risks**
   - Identify rabbit holes and unknowns.
   - Add "no-go" constraints or spikes if needed.
5. **Sketch the shape**
   - Use a breadboard or fat marker sketch to show flow and boundaries.

## Deliverable: Pitch

A pitch should fit in a short document and include:

- **Problem**: what we are solving and why it matters.
- **Appetite**: fixed time box for this work.
- **Solution**: high-level approach, key screens or flows.
- **Boundaries**: what is in and out of scope.
- **Risks**: known unknowns and how to avoid rabbit holes.

## Quality Checks

- The solution is concrete enough to build without constant clarifications.
- The appetite is fixed and not negotiated during execution.
- The scope is bounded and there is a clear "done" state.

## Common Anti-Patterns

- Backlog grooming without a clear appetite.
- Turning shaping into a long analysis project.
- Handing executors a list of tasks instead of a shaped solution.
