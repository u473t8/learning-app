# Executor Guide (Shape Up)

This guide explains how to take a shaped pitch and build it within a fixed appetite.
Execution is about making trade-offs inside the boundary, not expanding the boundary.

## Purpose

- Deliver the shaped solution inside the time box.
- Manage scope by cutting or simplifying, not by extending time.
- Provide steady visibility into progress and risks.

## Starting a Cycle

- Read the pitch and confirm the appetite.
- Ask clarifying questions before work begins.
- Break the work into tasks that reflect the shaped solution.

## Core Rules

- **Appetite is fixed**: do not extend the time box.
- **Scope is flexible**: cut or simplify to fit.
- **Build what was shaped**: do not reshape during execution.
- **Ship value early**: aim for the smallest slice that proves the approach.

## Day-to-Day Execution

- Start with the riskiest unknowns.
- Integrate frequently so progress is visible.
- Keep tasks small and concrete.
- Capture decisions that impact scope or quality.

## Managing Scope

When time is tight, adjust in this order:

1. Remove optional polish.
2. Reduce edge cases.
3. Simplify UI and workflow.
4. Re-scope the solution while preserving the core value.

If none of these are enough, stop and raise the risk to the bet owner.

## Progress Tracking

- Use a hill chart or short daily update.
- Focus updates on risk reduction and completed scope.
- Call out scope cuts explicitly.

## Handoff and Wrap-Up

- Ship when the core value is delivered.
- Document what was cut and why.
- Capture follow-ups as separate pitches, not mid-cycle additions.

## Common Anti-Patterns

- Expanding scope to chase "nice to have" ideas.
- Re-shaping because something feels hard.
- Letting small unknowns linger until the end.
