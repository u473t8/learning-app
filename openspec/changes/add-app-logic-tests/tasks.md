## 1. Architectural Evaluation
- [x] 1.1 Map current app-logic IO boundaries (DB/network/side effects)
- [x] 1.2 Propose minimal refactors to separate pure logic from IO
- [x] 1.3 Decide on placement (src/shared vs src/client/domain)

## 2. Tests: Word Operations
- [x] 2.1 Add fixtures for vocab words and reviews
- [x] 2.2 Unit tests for add/update/delete word flows
- [x] 2.3 Unit tests for filtering/searching and retention-level sorting

## 3. Tests: Lesson Flow
- [x] 3.1 Add fixtures for lessons/trials/examples
- [x] 3.2 Unit tests for trial generation and selection
- [x] 3.3 Unit tests for answer checking and advance/finish logic

## 4. Validation
- [x] 4.1 Ensure tests run without external services
- [x] 4.2 Update checklist to completed after implementation
